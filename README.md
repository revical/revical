Revical (from **Revi**sion Re**cal**l), is an *open-source*, *privacy-centered* knowledge management and revision platform. Think of it like a combination of [**Anki**](https://apps.ankiweb.net), [**Logseq**](https://logseq.com), and [**Habitica**](https://habitica.com).

## üëÄ Usage

Revical is in the *alpha* stages of development, and so it is not yet ready for use. A ‚≠ê on this repository will help us know that you are **interested** in using Revical, and will help me know that my work is not going unnoticed.
