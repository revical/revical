Revical (from **Revi**sion Re**cal**l), is an *open-source*, *privacy-centered* knowledge management and revision platform. Think of it like a combination of [**Anki**](https://apps.ankiweb.net), [**Logseq**](https://logseq.com), and [**Habitica**](https://habitica.com).

## üëÄ Usage

Revical is in the *alpha* stages of development, and so it is not yet ready for use. A ‚≠ê **star** on this repository will help us know that you are **interested** in using Revical, and will help me know that my work is not going unnoticed.

## ‚ú® Inspiration

Revical is inspired by many projects, but namely:

- [**Anki**](https://apps.ankiweb.net) - A spaced repetition flashcard program.
- [**Logseq**](https://logseq.com) - A notebook for organizing and sharing your personal knowledge base.
- [**Habitica**](https://habitica.com) - A habit tracker app which treats your goals like a Role Playing Game.
- [**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md) - A knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files.

Revical is also made possible by the following projects:

- [**Wails**](https://wails.io) - A framework for building desktop apps using Go and Web Technologies.
